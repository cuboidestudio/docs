      <Step title="Override Minecraft translations">
        Translations are used to hide the "Inventory" text showing in the middle of player inventories. Not overriding them won't break your interfaces but will have a significant esthetic impact.

        **Step-by-step guide**

        1. In the pack files, navigate to `ItemsAdder Setup/ItemsAdder/contents/`
        2. Copy the `minecraft/` subfolder
        3. In your server files, navigate to `plugins/ItemsAdder/contents/`
        4. Paste the folder

        <Warning>
          If you have other translation files from other contents, check that copying and pasting the file won't delete other necessary translation overrides.
